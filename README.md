# Vaccine-for-all

This is the submissiosn for the Electra Hacks. The project allows the user to search the nearby vaccination centers by their pincode or the district. It then shows the user the available centers with basic information like vaccine types, available vaccine doses for dose 1 and 2, prices and age limit. Also there is a button which shows the location of the center on google maps.
You can find the site [here](https://vaccine-for-all.netlify.app/)

Note- The location shown is not correct as the api provides rounded off values for the latitude and longitude. However this project can be taken further in showing the accurate location
